# Our Idea ðŸ’¡
- Medify is an Android application that not only solves the issue of the patients as users, but also solves the problems of the doctors as well.

- The app offers users to book an appointment with the doctor that are registered in the app already.

- The waiting queue is sorted according to the priority and not â€˜First Come First Serveâ€™ which allows all the patients to get equal priority.

- The users can upload their prescription which only keeps the latest upload which the doctor can check.

- The users can monitor their health data which is shown in a chart of last 5 data from their report.

# App Features ðŸŽ¯

- <b>Appointment Booking:</b> The user can search doctors by their name, phone or email to book an appointment.
The users have to answer some questions regarding their issue, this way the appointment is booked.
- <b>Appointment Sorting:</b> We designed an alorithm that analyses the user data, makes some calculation and sorts the patient queue according to the priority. 
This way every patient gets priority equally.
- <b>Prescription:</b> The user uploads their latest prescrition in the app, so when booken an appointment, the doctor can check their recent 
prescription and hence carrying prescription is not required.
- <b>Statistics:</b> The user can add and monitor their past 5 data of health reports which is displayed using charts.
- <b>Instant UPI:</b> When asked about the fee amount, it sounds quite unprofessional for Doctors when they have to tell about it. 
But from now, the Doctor can add their fee details and the app generates a QR Code iteself.
- <b>Appointment / Patient Queue List:</b> The users can check their appointment list of all doctors to which they booked appointment. 
The patient queue is a list that is sorted using our alogrithm and displayed.
